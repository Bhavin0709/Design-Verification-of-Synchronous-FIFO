# Design-Verification-of-Synchronous-FIFO

This project focuses on the design and verification of a Synchronous FIFO (First-In, First-Out) buffer. The FIFO can store data with the following specifications:

- **Data Width**: 8 bits  
- **Depth**: 16  

The design ensures efficient data handling for systems requiring sequential data access. Verification is carried out to validate its functionality under various scenarios.
